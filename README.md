This program is proudly written without any help of AI/code completion. Going back to ancient time and use stackoverflow and google instead.

This program is to test out my program design capability in c++, along with getting clear with some concepts in C++.

The implementation is written as close as possible with standard vector by following https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector.html (I skipped some stuff here and there due to complexity in some codes)

The program is written using the TDD philosophy.
